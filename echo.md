Potential features
==================


        1. think about adding rss feeds
        2. also about adding real time bus times > where it shows two time simultaneously  -- maybe with a drop down menu or inputs where it would display on the toprighthand corner 
        3. we can use the google api to scan pictures to find out what type of food or fruit it is and information about it 
        4. no need for cookie log in most groups abandon it so use passport.
